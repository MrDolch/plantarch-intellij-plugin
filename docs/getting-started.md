## Getting Started

### Create a New Diagram

1. Open a Java class in the editor.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+A` to open the action menu.
3. Select **Render PlantArch Diagram**.

A diagram will be rendered with the selected class in focus.
On the first run, rendering may take a little longer because all classes need to be compiled and dependencies collected.
After that, diagrams will load faster.
All dependent classes and libraries will be displayed automatically.

### Working with a Diagram

1. Make sure the editor tab is set to PlantArch Editor (button at the bottom).
   Otherwise, you will only see the raw diagram source as text.
2. Add classes to focus → Click on them.
3. Remove libraries → Click on them.
4. Remove classes → Click on them while holding Ctrl.

The diagram updates automatically. Depending on project size, this may take a few seconds.
