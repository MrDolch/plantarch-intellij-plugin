# plantarch-intellij-plugin Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.3] - 2025-09-20

### Added

* **Marker patterns** (`exact classname`, `Prefix*`, `*Suffix`) with inferred stereotypes in PlantUML.
* **Jar promotion**: auto-include JARs that contain any `classesToAnalyze`.
* **Jump to Project view** for libraries; **Clear Cache** button.
* PlantUML render **error notification**.

### Changed

* **UI rework**: removed ClassTreePanel; interact directly on the diagram (context menus for Show Packages/Methods, Show/Unhide Libraries, Add Class, Focus/Hide/Make Marker).
* **PlantUML generation**: `toPlantUml(deps, params, promotedJarNames)`; smarter container filtering and marker stereotypes from patterns.
* **State/params**: lists â†’ **sets** (`classesToAnalyze`, `classesToHide`, `librariesToHide`, `markerClasses`); new `classesInDiagram`, `librariesDiscovered`. UI labels: *Caption*, *Styles*.

### Removed

* ClassTreePanel and related editor-selection wiring/tests.

### Fixed

* Cleaner edge filtering; safer library handling (no UNKNOWN/unwanted JARs).

### Dev notes

* Update tests to use sets and new `toPlantUml(..., ..., emptySet())`.
* `markerClasses` now `MarkerClasses(setOf(...))`.
